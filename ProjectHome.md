This is an enhanced version of the [svg-android](http://code.google.com/p/svg-android/) project, which supplies Scalable Vector Graphics Support for Android.

This project, a "fork" of the svg-android project, exists to provide additional capabilities to the svg-android project; hopefully the changes and enhancements in this library will be folded in to svg-android someday.

Note:  This project is being migrated to:
[github](https://github.com/thinkingcow/svg-android-2) as code.google.com is shutting down
